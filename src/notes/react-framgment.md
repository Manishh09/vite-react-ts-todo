## React Fragments

- React Fragment is a way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

- It is useful when you want to return multiple elements from a component without wrapping them in a div or other HTML element.
  
- In the above code, we are using React Fragment to group the elements returned by the App component.
  
- This allows us to return multiple elements `without adding an extra div or other HTML element to the DOM`.

- React Fragment is represented by the empty angle brackets` <>` and `</>`.
 
- It is a shorthand syntax for `React.Fragment`.
